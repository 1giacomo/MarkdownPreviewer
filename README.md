# Markdown Preview Site
This is a raw Markdown Previewer created for the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer) course.

## Overview
This site allows users to preview their Markdown text in real-time as they type.

Markdown is a markup language that makes it easy to format text; this language is also used in `README.md` files.

## Features
- Live preview of Markdown text
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks

## Usage
1. Enter your Markdown text in the textarea.
2. The preview will automatically update in the right panel as you type.

## Libraries and API
For this project I used HTML, Js, and its Frontend libraries.

I've used the official [Marked API](https://marked.js.org/).
